# Diabetes-project
Training a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is at the risk of getting diabetes.
The objective is to create a machine learning model to predict patients that have early stages of diabetes. According to studies misdiagnosis of Diabetes is very common and effects of misdiagnosis or late diagnosis can be serious and life changing. Therefore, the machine learning model is designed to solve problems arising from misdiagnosis of diabetes to ensure that the disease is detected early to facilitate proper treatment.
